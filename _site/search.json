    "text": "To Cadets:\nThis course, MA206, introduces you to the foundational principles of probability and statistics, emphasizing data literacy and inference. It begins with Block I, covering data types, visualization, and basic probability rules including counting and the behavior of random variables. Block II builds on this by exploring discrete and continuous distributions, the Central Limit Theorem, and tools for one-sample inference such as confidence intervals and hypothesis testing for proportions and means. Finally, Block III develops cadets’ ability to analyze relationships between variables through two-sample tests, linear regression, ANOVA, and goodness-of-fit testing. By the end of the course, cadets will be equipped to make sound, data-driven decisions grounded in statistical reasoning.\nA Note on Technology:\nIn this course the primary tool used for data analysis is R. Throughout this course you will implement techniques for summarizing, visualizing, and analyzing data. The primary focus of this course is not for you to become masters in coding, however building on skills learned in CY105 will help your analysis in understanding how to use information technology to demonstrate successful outcomes in this course.\nOf note, some of the functions we use in R require the package tidyverse, everytime you begin working in RStudio, the beginning code chunk should resemble:\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\n── Attaching core tidyverse packages ──────────────────────── tidyverse 2.0.0 ──\n✔ dplyr     1.1.4     ✔ readr     2.1.5\n✔ forcats   1.0.0     ✔ stringr   1.5.1\n✔ ggplot2   3.5.2     ✔ tibble    3.2.1\n✔ lubridate 1.9.4     ✔ tidyr     1.3.1\n✔ purrr     1.0.4     \n── Conflicts ────────────────────────────────────────── tidyverse_conflicts() ──\n✖ dplyr::filter() masks stats::filter()\n✖ dplyr::lag()    masks stats::lag()\nℹ Use the conflicted package (&lt;http://conflicted.r-lib.org/&gt;) to force all conflicts to become errors\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFundamental to statistical analysis is understanding the types of data we encounter, the methods we use to collect them, and the potential sources of bias that can undermine the validity of our conclusions. We distinguish between categorical (qualitative) and quantitative (numerical) data, and further classify quantitative data as discrete or continuous. Understanding these distinctions is critical for selecting the correct tools for analysis and interpretation.\nWe also examine various sampling methods, including simple random sampling, stratified sampling, cluster sampling, and systematic sampling. Each method has strengths and weaknesses depending on the research context, and knowing when to apply each appropriately is a key skill for data-driven decision-making.\nFinally, we explore the concept of bias in data collection. We identify common sources such as selection bias, response bias, and measurement bias, and discuss how poor sampling practices or flawed survey design can distort findings. This lesson sets the stage for the rest of the course by highlighting the importance of thoughtful data collection and critical evaluation of data sources.\nAs an example let us look at data aggregated from the sinking of the titanic.

It must be well-defined, have more than one possible outcome, and be repeatable under similar conditions. Each performance of the experiment results in a single outcome from the sample space. The sample space is the set of all possible outcomes of a random experiment.\n\nDefinition:\n\nThe sample space is the set of all possible outcomes of a random experiment, denoted ( ).\nAn event is a subset of the sample space.

These arise depending on when things are “allowed” to repeat or the “order” items are chosen in matters. The ability to discern when these four situations arise is more than half the battle.\n\n\nThink of the number of ways of choosing a 4-digit passcode on your phone.\nThe order of the numbers matters, and you are allowed to repeat the same number. So how many arrangements are there? Since repetition is allowed and order matters, there are 10 digits for each position, giving:\n\\[\n\\text{Ordered Arrangements with Replacement} = n^r = 10^4 = 10{,}000\n\\]\n\n\n\nThink of the number of ways I can create a batting order from 9 position players.\nThe order still matters, but players cannot be repeated. This is a permutation — an ordered arrangement without replacement.\n\\[\n{}_nP_r = P(n, r) = \\frac{n!}{(n - r)!}\n\\]\nFor example, the number of ways to assign the first 3 batting positions from 9 players:\n\\[\n{}_9P_3 = \\frac{9!}{(9-3)!} = 9 \\times 8 \\times 7 = 504\n\\]\n\n\n\nThink of how many ways you can choose 3 scoops of ice cream from 5 unique flavors without repeats.\nBecause order doesn’t matter and repeats aren’t allowed, we use combinations:\n\\[\n{}_nC_k = \\binom{n}{k} = \\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}\n\\]\n\n\n\nThink of how many different combinations of 3 scoop ice cream cones you can make with 5 unique flavors while allowing repeats.\nThis is the trickiest scenario. The order doesn’t matter, and repetition is allowed. The formula is:\n\\[\n\\text{Unordered Arrangements with Replacement} = \\binom{r+n-1}{r} = \\frac{(r+n-1)!}{r!(n-1)!}\n\\]\nExample: choosing 3 scoops from 5 flavors (with repeats):\n\\[\n\\binom{3+5-1}{3} = \\binom{7}{3} = 35\n\\]\nThis can be understood using the stars and bars method: selecting ( r ) scoops with ( n-1 ) dividers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-   Binomial Distribution: EX, Var(X), PDF, CDF\\\n\n-   Geometric Distribution: EX, Var(X), PDF, CDF\\\n\n\n\n-   CLT & the Normal Distribution: EX, Var(X), PDF, CDF\\\n\n-   Exponential Distribution: EX, Var(X), PDF, CDF\\\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-   Single Proportion\\\n\n-   Single Mean\\\n\n-   Experimental Design: Power, T1/II Error\\\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-   Lesson 17: Difference of Proportions\\\n\n-   Lesson 18: Multiple Proportions\\\n\n-   Lesson 19: Difference of Means\\\n\n-   Lesson 20: Paired Data\\\n\n\n\n-   Lesson 21: Simple Linear Regression\\\n\n-   Lesson 22: Multiple Linear Regression\\\n\n-   Lesson 23: Goodness of Fit\n\n-   Lesson 24: ANOVA"

This is a permutation — an ordered arrangement without replacement.\n\\[\n{}_nP_r = P(n, r) = \\frac{n!}{(n - r)!}\n\\]\nFor example, the number of ways to assign the first 3 batting positions from 9 players:\n\\[\n{}_9P_3 = \\frac{9!}{(9-3)!} = 9 \\times 8 \\times 7 = 504\n\\]\n\n\n\nThink of how many ways you can choose 3 scoops of ice cream from 5 unique flavors without repeats.\nBecause order doesn’t matter and repeats aren’t allowed, we use combinations:\n\\[\n{}_nC_k = \\binom{n}{k} = \\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}\n\\]\n\n\n\nThink of how many different combinations of 3 scoop ice cream cones you can make with 5 unique flavors while allowing repeats.\nThis is the trickiest scenario. The order doesn’t matter, and repetition is allowed. The formula is:\n\\[\n\\text{Unordered Arrangements with Replacement} = \\binom{r+n-1}{r} = \\frac{(r+n-1)!}{r!(n-1)!}\n\\]\nExample: choosing 3 scoops from 5 flavors (with repeats):\n\\[\n\\binom{3+5-1}{3} = \\binom{7}{3} = 35\n\\]\nThis can be understood using the stars and bars method: selecting ( r ) scoops with ( n-1 ) dividers."
